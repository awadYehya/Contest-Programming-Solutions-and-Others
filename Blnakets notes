1. Going from a person that accepts anything as fact from grownups and that they're all right.
After living with Reina he came back home understanding that his connection with his brother needed to be fixed.

2. When Craig and Reina were alone, their masks were off, but when people were around (especially their parents) they
would hide their deep emotions towards eachother and would interact differently.

3. It slowly develops throughout the book. Unlike modern culture which makes it seems it's essential to engage in sexual
acts straight away their sexual relationship seems to naturally develop and the acts would just occur randomly unplanned. It shows that they both care that their sexual would be non-artificial and just pure natural. This is then what Craig says he believes in. He believes the human connection.

4. Yes. It makes the book much more reliable and more relatable. You can use this book to actually help you make judgements in your own life. If something really happened before then it's plausible to believe it might happen again. However, were it purely fiction then the book would entirely be about how the authors views the world rather than what actually happens in the world.
